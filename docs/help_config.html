    JRPN 15C/16C - Screen Configuration Guide
</p>
<p>
The calculator's button layout and other screen configuration items
can be customized.  For example, the button layout in portrait mode could
changed - there's no "standard" portrait button layout for these calculators
any.  The default 6x7 layout can be change to 5x8, to allow a taller and
narrower calculator, too.  The landscape layout can also be changed, but
that would of course mean not being faithful to the original calculator.
<p>
In addition, keyboard accelerators can be mapped and/or added.  The default
keyboard acceleratos aren't standard in any way, and were chosen somewhat
arbitrarily, so it could be interesting to re-map them.
<p>
To restore the default, simply set the screen configuration to the
blank JSON object, "<code>{}</code>".
<p>
The JSON file is read into the calculator from Settings, System Settings.  On
desktop programs you read the JSON from a file; on mobile phones, it's read
from the copy/paste buffer.  Following is a valid JSON file for the 15C
that rearranges the keyboard, and configures other configurable items:

<p>
In thie file, keys are identified by their default primary 
keyboard accelerator.  To find the accelerators, select
Settings -> Show Accelerators.  Some of the settings have
measurements.  These are approximately centimeters, when the
calculator is sized to about the size of the physical
calculator.
<p>
Taking the entries in turn:
<p>
<b><code>accelerators</code></b>
<p>
Defines keyboard accelerator mappings,  Each element maps a keystroke
to a different keystroke.  For example, the first entry maps "Z" to "N",
which on the 15C is the accelerator for the on/off button.  With this, typing
"ZZ" in JRPN will cause the app to quite.  The second entry maps the space
bar to newline, which is the accelerator for the enter key.
<p>
Accelerators can also map to some functions normally accessed through the
menu.  The three starting with "<code>lcd_</code>" change the handling
of long numbers, where "window" is the 16C name for the default behavior,
where the LCD display doesn't grow, and doesn't shrink down digits to fit.
"<code>internals</code>" shows the Calculator Internals window, and
"<code>back_panel</code>" shows the back panel.
<p>
<b><code>accelerator_labels</code></b>
<p>
Each entry re-defines the green accelerator label for the given
key.  For example, the first entry redefines the label for the
on botton (identified by "N") to "NZ".  This is rendered with N on
top of Z, to indicate to the user that both are acceptable
accelerators for that key.  The second entry redefines enter
to have the labels of a unicode symbol for enter, and the unicode
space symbol
<p>
<b><code>portrait</code></b>
<p>
An object called "portrait" contains a screen layout for portrait
mode.  If not present, the default layout will be used.
<p>
<b><code>portrait.buttons</code></b>
<p>
This object gives the keyboard layout.  Each key is defined
by its primary default accelerator (if a key has two default
accelerators, it's the first one).  <code>null</code> is used
where there should not be a key.  The buttons section is mandatory.
<p>

<b><code>portrait.logo</code></b>
<p>
This gives the rectangle where the JRPN logo is to be drawn,
given in cm as left, top, width and height.  If not present,
it will be drawn in the default place; for portrait mode, this
occupies the lower-right hand corner of the keyboard.  To suppress
drawing of the logo, specify "[ ]" instead of rectangle
coordinates.
<p>

<b><code>portrait.size</code></b>
<p>
This element, if present, changes the size of the calculator, in
centimeters.  The default size is 12.7x8 or 8x12.7, depending on
orientation.  The calculator's graphical elements are, generally
speaking, drawn at fixed positions within the coordinate system
defined by the size.  Of course, the actual drawing on a device is
scaled so that it just fits within the available window.
<p>
<b><code>portrait.top_labels</code></b>
<p>
This element, if present, is used to re-define the drawing of
the extra gold labels on the keyboard.  If you move the keys
th at have upper labels, you need to re-define where they are
drawn.  On the 15C, this is the "CLEAR" label above the four
keys; on the 16C, it's "SHOW", "CLEAR" and "SET COMPL".
<p>
After the string lablel, give the x,y position and the width and
height of the label to be drawn.  This rectangle includes the
lines.  It's OK to repeat a label; in the sample given, the
clear-sigma key isn't next to the other three clear keys, so the
label needs to be repeated in two places.  On
the 16C, "SHOW" is rendered in a bigger font; you can get this
font by giving the string "big" after the coordinates.
<p>
<b><code>landscape</code></b>
<p>
An object called "landscape" contains a screen layout for portrait
mode.  If not present, the default layout will be used.  The elements
of the landscape object are the same as portrait.
<p>
<b><code>button_look</code></b>
<p>
An object called "button_look" controls various parameters used to draw buttons.
The values given above are the default values, used if a <code>button_look</code>
object is not present.  As of this writing, the fields of <code>button_look</code>
are just the ones that controll the look of a button when it is pressed.  Colors
are given as six-digit hex strings giving a 24 bit RGB color value.  What each
field of <code>button_look</code> is best figured out by looking at the code of
<code>lib/v/buttons.dart</code>.  Look for "<code>if (pressed)</code>".
<h2>Existing Configurations</h2>
<p>
The portrait layout given above probably isn't all that good.  Personally, I
rarely use portrait mode, and I don't really have an opinion on what a
good layout might be.  If you make a layout or other configuration file
that you'd like to share, feel free to attach a file to a comment on
